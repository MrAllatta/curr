* What Data Do We Need
** We would like to know ...
*** What questions do we have?
We would like to know if our grading system is a meaningful reflection
of students.
We would like to know if the tap water in our city is healthier than
the tap water in another city.
*** What data would we need to collect? 
*** How would you measure healthiness of water?
*** Over what timeframe would you ideally like to collect your data?
*** How would you ensure your sampling is fair?
*** How would you measure "better grades"?
*** Are there any threats to validity to keep in mind while collecting data?
