# Posting to your Blog

## Step 1: Create a new file in your ```_posts``` directory

1. Navigate to the _posts directory and click "Create New file"

2. Give your file a name using the pattern YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md

For example a weekly reflection post should have the date of the Friday of the week you are posting about. So on October 12th, 2018 your post title would be ```2018-10-12-weekly-reflection.md```

## Step 2: Setup your post file with a correct heading

1. At the top of the new file add a heading that tells Jekyll to use the post layout and which title and date to use when creating links for the post. For example the following markup would be at the top of the post file we created above.
```
---
layout: post
title: "Weekly Reflection #4"
date: 2018-10-12
---
```

2. Below the heading you write your reflection using Markdown syntax. The general structure of a post is
### Our Learning
+ Summarize lessons
+ Make connections
### My Learning
+ Reflect on contribution
+ Address needs
