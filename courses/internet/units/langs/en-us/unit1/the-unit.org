* The Web
A web page is a collection of computer files that can be read by web browser software. The @vocab{Web} is a system of interlinked files (documents or pages) often accessed via the Internet. Using the Internet web pages can be sent and received all across the world. One type of file that is used to create a web page is called an HTML file. The name of a file usually ends with an extension that tells us what type of file it is. For example if I have a website with a page called 'home' then the html file would be called 'home.html'. Another type of file that is used to create a web page is called a CSS file. The CSS file that goes along with our home page might be called 'home.css'.

* HTML and CSS
Web pages have a structure and a style. The structure of a page is like the frame of a building. It is the internal structure of a building that gives it its shape. The structure of a webpage is written in HTML. The style of a page is like the exterior of the building the same building may be painted many colors without changing its structure. The style of a page is written in CSS.

In a web page some of the styles include the color of the font and what font family you want to display your text. The size of the font and the color of the background can also be changed. There are many more elements of style that can be changed on you web page.

* Rendering

A web page is @vocab{render}ed by a @vocab{web browser}. A web browser is a specific software application such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome that is designed to display or render the page. If no style is specified the browser will apply a default style to the page.

* Markup
HTML is an example of a markup language. These languages enable us to specify the structure and content of a document. Another example of a markup language is Markdown, another is LaTex. We will look at these languages in future lessons.

In HTML we can specify that our content is a heading by wrapping it in a heading tag.
<h1> My First Heading </h1>
In a heading tag the content lives between an opening tag <h1> and a closing tag </h1>.
@activity[]{What is the difference between an opening and closing tag?}

Markdown is a markup language that makes it easier to write HTML pages. The same heading in Markdown would be
# My First Heading

* HTML Structure
An HTML document is built up of tags that describe the meaning of the
content between the tags. The opening tags is a surrounded by two
angle brackets <>. The closing tag is also surrounded by angle
brackets <>, but also begins with a forward slash /. For example a
normal paragraph of text like you would read in a book would look like
this <p>I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them Sam I
Am.</p>

How is HTML structure is similar to a Racket expression? A Racket
expression begins with an opening parenthesis and ends with a closing
parenthesis. Opening a closing marks set the boundary for every part
of the document. Just like in programming, HTML can be nested.

The opposite of HTML is called a WYSIWYG, which stands for "What you
see is what you get." Word processors like Google Docs and Word let
you change how somethings looks and see the change at the same
time. HTML is not a WYSIWYG. Instead HTML is a markup language, which
is a language for describing how a document should look.
